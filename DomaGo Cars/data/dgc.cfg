CONFIGURATION FILE FOR DOMAGO CARS

Explanation for settings you can change 
(we recommend not changing others as it can alter your game-playing experience quite a lot):

MAIN
numOfLaps -> number of laps
maxSimTime, maxSimDist, maxEvaTime, maxEvaDist -> used in AI learning to determine how long would simulation and evaluation last
tracks -> list of tracks that AI will learn on - whole list of tracks is on the bottom of this file (copy & paste it)
displayedTrack -> displayed track - whole list of tracks is on the bottom of this file (copy & paste it)

NEURAL NETWORKS
populationSize -> number of individuals in generation
generations -> number of generations

CGP
populationSize -> number of individuals in generation
generations -> number of generations
